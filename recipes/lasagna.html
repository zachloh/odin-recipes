      <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Assemble:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna sheets</li>
      <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds mozarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 pound parmesan cheese, grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <h4>Meat sauce:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil a large pot of salted water on high heat. Prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until lightly browned. Remove the beef to a bowl and drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</li>
      <li>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the same skillet. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, then add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
      <li>Return the browned ground beef to the skillet. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce and tomato paste to the pot.</li>
      <li>Add the parsley, oregano and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle some garlic powder to taste.</li>
      <li>Add the red or white wine vinegar and sugar to taste.</li>
      <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.</li>
      <li>When the salted water has boiled, add the dry lasagna sheets and cook them per package directions.</li>
      <li>When ready, drain the lasagna sheets and rinse with cool water.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Assemble:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375&#8457;.</li>
      <li>In a casserole or lasagna dish, spread a cup of sauce over the base, then cover with lasagna sheets.</li>
      <li>Spread another cup of sauce over the sheets and sprinkle some grated mozarella, parmesan and ricotta cheese.</li>
      <li>Apply second layer of lasagna sheets, and top it with some sauce, mozarella, parmesan and ricotta cheese again.</li>
      <li>Finish with another layer of lasagna sheets, spread the remaining sauce over the sheets and sprinkle some mozarella cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden and bubbling.</li>
      <li>Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
